Report for COMB_CSTB inner tumor against COMB_CSTB invasive tumor

Note about the statistical test: Test whether a sample differs from a normal distribution.
This function tests the null hypothesis that a sample comes from a normal distribution. It is based on D’Agostino and Pearson’s test that combines skew and kurtosis to produce an omnibus test of normality.

Null hypothesis: COMB_CSTB inner tumor comes from a normal distribution.
The null hypothesis can be rejected.

Null hypothesis: COMB_CSTB invasive tumor comes from a normal distribution.
The null hypothesis can be rejected.


Selected statistical test: Wilcoxon signed-rank test

Note about the statistical test:
The Wilcoxon signed-rank test tests the null hypothesis that two related paired samples come from the same distribution. In particular, it tests whether the distribution of the differences x - y is symmetric about zero. It is a non-parametric version of the paired T-test.



Siegel used the symbol T for a value related to, but not the same as, W {\displaystyle W} W. In consequence, the test is sometimes referred to as the Wilcoxon T test, and the test statistic is reported as a value of T.

The original Wilcoxon's proposal used a different statistic. Denoted by Siegel as the T statistic, it is the smaller of the two sums of ranks of given sign; in the example given below, therefore, T would equal 3+4+5+6=18. Low values of T are required for significance. As will be obvious from the example below, T is easier to calculate by hand than W and the test is equivalent to the two-sided test described above; however, the distribution of the statistic under H 0 {\displaystyle H_{0}} H_{0} has to be adjusted.

As demonstrated in the example, when the difference between the groups is zero, the observations are discarded. This is of particular concern if the samples are taken from a discrete distribution. In these scenarios the modification to the Wilcoxon test by Pratt 1959, provides an alternative which incorporates the zero differences.[4][5] This modification is more robust for data on an ordinal scale.[5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test)
