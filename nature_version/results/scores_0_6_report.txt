Report for COMB_CSTB inner tumor against COMB_CSTB invasive tumor

Note about the statistical test: Test whether a sample differs from a normal distribution.
This function tests the null hypothesis that a sample comes from a normal distribution. It is based on D’Agostino and Pearson’s test that combines skew and kurtosis to produce an omnibus test of normality.

Null hypothesis: COMB_CSTB inner tumor comes from a normal distribution.
The null hypothesis can be rejected.
