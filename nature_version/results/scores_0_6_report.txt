Report for COMB_CSTB inner tumor against COMB_CSTB invasive tumor

Note about the statistical test: Test whether a sample differs from a normal distribution.
This function tests the null hypothesis that a sample comes from a normal distribution. It is based on D’Agostino and Pearson’s test that combines skew and kurtosis to produce an omnibus test of normality.

Null hypothesis: COMB_CSTB inner tumor comes from a normal distribution.
The null hypothesis can be rejected.

Null hypothesis: COMB_CSTB invasive tumor comes from a normal distribution.
The null hypothesis can be rejected.


Selected statistical test: Wilcoxon rank-sum test

Note about the statistical test:
The Wilcoxon rank-sum test tests the null hypothesis that two sets of measurements are drawn from the same distribution. The alternative hypothesis is that values in one sample are more likely to be larger than the values in the other sample.
This test should be used to compare two samples from continuous distributions. It does not handle ties between measurements in x and y.

Means for COMB_CSTB inner tumor against COMB_CSTB invasive tumor: 2.25 against 2.50
The p-value found for COMB_CSTB inner tumor against COMB_CSTB invasive tumor is 0.3119982131283525
