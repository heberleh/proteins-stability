# Evaluation of feature selection and ranking methods' stability in the context of discovery proteomics data

Scripts for the Double Cross Validation described in my thesis.


The script was designed to handle datasets with small number of samples (~50) and bigger number of variables (~800).

It uses many classifiers and Heavy feature selection procedures.

Considering a laptop with i7: the ranking may take minutes/hours and the prioritization based on small sets of features may take days. In my study, 5 days.

Any performance and design improvements are welcome!
